# MachineLearning_Project
Explored supervised machine learning methods, tweaking parameters and using stacking to increase predictability.

- I will be applying support machine vectors (SMV), decision trees and k-nearest neighbour algorithms to train a dataset to precisely identify the main contributors towards maternal mortality risk within Bangladesh. After modelling I will be using feature selection, to reduce the number of attributes contributing towards the model, helping to improve the performance of the model. Our results found that stacking of both SVM and decision trees gave the most accurate results

- The dataset is in a structured format with 1014 instances, comprising of 7 attributes that are a mixture of integers, floats, and objects. Fortunately, there are no missing entries across the entire dataset. The properties contain the age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar levels, body temperature, heart rate and the associated level of maternal risk, ranked low, mid, and high. The attributes give us an overall understanding of the health of the individual. Specifically, heart health.
